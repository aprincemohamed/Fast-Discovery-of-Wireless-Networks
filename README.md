# Fast-Discovery-of-Wireless-Networks

srs_deep_fading.m : In this matlab file, we perform the simulation for the proposed network  discovery  algorithm  with  and  without  interference cancellation. In addition, we examine the effect of a fading model to the network discovery problem 

srs_radius.m : In this file, we perform simulations to discuss the effect of locally  connected  transmitting  nodes on the proposed network discovery process.
